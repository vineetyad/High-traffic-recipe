# High-traffic-recipe
The objective is to improve platform success by accurately identifying recipes likely to generate high traffic, with a minimum 80% accuracy rate. After thorough data validation, cleaning, analysis, and model creation, the Logistic Regression model emerged as the most effective for predicting high-traffic recipes.

## Key insights from exploratory data analysis include:

Right-skewness in numeric distributions necessitated normalization, while categorical variables showed a balanced scenario with 'breakfast' as a favored category.
'Vegetable,' 'Potato,' and 'Pork' recipes were identified as high-traffic magnets.
Recipes with 6 servings tend to attract higher traffic rates.
The top three categories driving high traffic are "Vegetable," "Potato," and "Pork."
Logistic Regression outperformed other models in terms of precision (80.34%) and minimal overfitting.
The custom Key Performance Indicator (KPI) of "High Traffic Conversion Rate" was used to assess model performance, aiming to maintain a KPI of 4.0 or higher. Logistic Regression consistently demonstrated reliability in predicting high-traffic recipes.

Challenges such as overfitting and underfitting were addressed, and strategies for model enhancement were proposed, including deployment methods, data collection, and feature engineering.

In conclusion, the data-driven approach validated Logistic Regression as the most reliable model for predicting high-traffic recipes, with insights gained for future model improvements.
